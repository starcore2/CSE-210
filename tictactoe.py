#Space for import if needed
#While drawing it out I found how I can make ticktactoe work on a single list. 
#The trick is at cell 1 of a 3by3 grid if you want to go down, add 3. 
#If you want to go down and left add 2, down right is 4. 
#For any N of grid. N by N down is add N, up is -N, down right is N+1 and so on.
#I'm reminded of some 2-d software is actully a 1D software with this clever method comment someone made.
