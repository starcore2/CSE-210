Q: How did you use a version control system to develop the programs? 
As of right now, to use it as a back up and potetintaly a way to move my code to differnt comptures.
My laptop while great for typing sucks at trying to use the smart code highlights and running the debug.
As of right now, I can't use the stronger comptures because I was comfirmed to have covid. 
And the people I'm living with don't have it. Which means I can't use the more powerful comptures for 
programing unless if I want to risk them which I don't. So yeah, This code is litteraly made with faith in my skills
I'm impressed if it works somehow with out my testing. 

Version control allows devolpers to write and compair code over time. 
If multiple devolpers upload differint versions at once, you can compair them to see what's differnt.
